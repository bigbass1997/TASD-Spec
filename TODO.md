List of things that would probably be good to add in the future

- Add usage explanation for tools in `README.md`
- Add dump script support for more emulators and for more consoles
- Add more tools that make creating or editing TASD files easier
- Add packet examples to `src/docs/draft-tasd-spec-0001.xml`
- Add example `.tasd` files
