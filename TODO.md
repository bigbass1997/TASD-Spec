List of things that would probably be good to add in the future

- Add valid example `.tasd` files
- Investigate moving related tools/scripts to a different repository (providing links will still be okay, but the actual tools should live elsewhere).
  - Add dump script support for more emulators and for more consoles
  - Add more tools that make creating or editing TASD files easier
- Add packet examples to `src/docs/draft-tasd-spec-0001.xml` (can be added post-release)
