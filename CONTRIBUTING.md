If you wish to contribute to this project, please be aware of and follow these rules.

* If you make an update to this repository, please update the `CHANGELOG.md` file accordingly.  The style of the `CHANGELOG.md` file is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), although currently without version numbers added.
* If you edit the `.xml` file in `src/docs/`, please update the changelog at the bottom of the `.xml` file.  The current style is `draft [{DraftNum}] - {Year}-{Month}-{Day}   {Initials}    {Description}` followed by a new line, where {DraftNum} is an incrementing 2 digit decimal number (can be 00-99), {Year} is the 4 digit year number, {Month} is the 2 digit month number, {Day} is the 2 digit day number, {Initials} are some initials to help differentiate changelog editors (Vi Grey's initials are **VG**, for example), and {Description} is a description of what you changed.
* If you edit the ``.xml` file in `src/docs/`, use `make clean; make; make contribution` at the root directory of this repository to create the new document files and automatically add them to `docs/latest/` and `docs/tasd-spec-{version}/`.
* Please (for the moment at least) try to keep individual updates relatively single-subject in nature.  For instance, if you're working on fixing a bunch of typos, try to make the update essentially only about fixing typos.
